#Tic Tac Toe
Hello, this is my first repo on Github. I have made this android development project using java. This android app is a Gaming app. The game is known
as "**Tic Tac Toe**".

  Tic Tac Toe is a game for two players. It is a board game. The board has 3x3 grid. Both Player gives his/her turn alternetively, untill one of them win
or the game ends with draw. Who takes turn marks one of the spaces in 3x3 grid, one of the player marks with "**O**" and other marks with "**X**".  The
Player who succeeded in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical or a diagonal row wins the game. If none of the two players succeeded to 
do that the game ends with draw.

  In this app you can play this game as a single player( vs app) or you can play with your friends. In single player mode there are four difficulty levels:
Easy, Medium, Hard and Expert. 

  You can also see the number of wins, draw and loss in the game. You can select the game sound to be turned on or off. When you install the app the game 
sound will be set to be turned on. And the game difficulty level is set to medium by default in single player mode. But you can change it and choose any
other difficulty level: Easy, Hard or Expert.
